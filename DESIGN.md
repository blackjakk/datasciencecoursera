# DESIGN.md — how MONEYLEAGUE should look

Read this BEFORE building or changing any UI (helper, PDF builders, charts).
It is the intent layer of the design system:

| Layer | File | Question it answers |
|---|---|---|
| Values | `design/tokens.json` (→ generated `ml.css`/`tokens.py`) | what exact color/size |
| Catalog | `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` | what components/API exist |
| **Intent** | **this file** | which to choose, and why |
| Law | `scripts/check_design_system.py` + `check_a11y.py` | what gets blocked |
| Review | `design-review` + `a11y-review` skills | the judgment pass |

**This file never states a color value.** Reference tokens by name
(`--ml-danger`, `position.TE`); the RAW HEX check scans this file and fails
the build on any hex literal here. If intent and tokens seem to disagree,
tokens win — then fix whichever is wrong in its own layer.

## The aesthetic: The Exchange

The league is literally named for money, and drafting under a clock *is*
trading under a closing bell. Every surface reads money through one of two
materials — never through dollar-sign clip-art:

- **The trading terminal** (dark theme, the live tool): vault-green
  surfaces (`surface.dark`), monospaced tabular numerals, a static ticker
  tape, a gold closing bell. A Bloomberg terminal for a 12-team keeper
  league — screens read under clock pressure, at a desk or on a phone.
- **The engraved banknote** (light theme, the printed reports): banknote
  cream paper (`surface.light`), engraving-ink text, guilloché line
  texture (`design/guilloche.py`), serial numbers, seals, fine print.
  Currency engraving is a print-native idiom; the PDFs inherit it
  automatically through `report_base_css()`.

The theme is *display and language only*: it renames labels and dresses
surfaces, it never changes what a number means or hides one.

1. **Data is the interface.** Numbers and names are the heroes; chrome
   recedes. If a decoration competes with a fact, the decoration loses.
   Guilloché stays at engraving opacity (the generator defaults are tuned
   for this) — texture must disappear the moment you read the table.
2. **Color is meaning, never decoration.** Every hue on screen encodes
   something (position, urgency, ownership, market state). A color with no
   meaning is visual noise — leave it out. The vault greens are *surfaces*,
   not signals: they carry no meaning beyond "this is The Exchange".
3. **Flat.** Separation comes from surface steps (`bg → panel → panel2`)
   and 1px borders — never drop shadows, never glassmorphism. Banknote
   texture is line work, not depth.
4. **Motion is spent on exactly two things.** (a) *Urgency*: `ml-pulse`
   means "act now" (you're up / 2 away / live). (b) *Receipts*: `ml-flash`
   (`ml-receipt` keyframe) is a single-fire ≤900ms background fade that
   acknowledges a user action — a fill landing, an undo returning — and
   never loops. Nothing else moves, nothing ambient ever moves —
   **the tape is static, always** (`.ml-tape` never animates, never
   marquees; it is a strip of facts, not ambience). Loading skeletons
   (`.ml-skeleton`) are static blocks — no shimmer. Reduced-motion users
   get the same states via solid color (both animations are killed).
5. **Dense, with rhythm.** Draft decisions need many facts per screen-inch;
   density is a feature. Rhythm comes from the `space.*` tokens, not
   eyeballed padding.
6. **Accessibility is part of the look.** The focus ring, 40px touch
   targets, text-carrying-meaning — these are design, not compliance
   afterthoughts. docs/A11Y_AUDIT.md is part of this system's history.

## Color doctrine

- **Position hues are identity.** QB/RB/WR/TE/K/DEF each own their hue
  (`color.position`) everywhere — helper table, PDF cards, matplotlib
  series. Never reuse a position hue to mean anything else, and never
  introduce a second hue for the same position.
- **Traffic-light semantics are reserved for actionability.**
  `--ml-success` = safe / can wait / gain. `--ml-warn` = coin flip /
  2-away / rookie risk. `--ml-danger` = now-or-never / injury / LIVE /
  loss. Don't spend these on anything that isn't a call to judgment.
  Never green-tint data that isn't gain/loss; survival % keeps its own
  traffic-light scale.
- **Gold doctrine.** `--ml-gold` (text) and the `--ml-gold-chip` pairing
  are spent on exactly two meanings: **market state** (the closing bell —
  `.ml-clock--me`) and the **blue-chip tier** (`.ml-badge--bluechip`,
  top-of-market assets only, used sparingly). Gold on anything else is
  decoration and gets rejected. The one sanctioned ornament is the faint
  gold radial tint baked into `.ml-seal`.
- **Three greens, three jobs.** WR's position hue, `--ml-success`
  (gain/safe), and the vault-green surfaces coexist because the surfaces
  are very dark (dark theme) or ink-on-cream (light theme) — background
  material, never a signal. Never introduce a fourth green, and never use
  a surface green as text.
- `--ml-info` / `--ml-keeper` (blue) = factual annotation, never urgency.
- The brand gradient exists **only** on the app header / report mastheads,
  and the only text color on it is `--ml-on-brand`.
- `--ml-muted` is for secondary facts (team, ADP, round tags) and fine
  print; primary facts get `--ml-text`. If you're unsure, it's primary.
- Tint overlays (`--ml-target-tint`, `--ml-mine-tint`) are never the sole
  signal — always pair a glyph or text (★, "(your pick)").
- New on-color text? Use the measured polarity table in
  docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md; never guess white-vs-black. The gold chip is
  dark-text-on-gold in BOTH themes — never put white on gold.

## Language doctrine (GUAP & market terms)

- **Renames label, never replace.** Market language decorates the real
  stat; the number stays. VAL keeps its hidden VBD expansion; "contract:
  keep '27 @ R4" keeps the round math; BUY sits on a row that still shows
  the projection. If a themed term hides a number, the term loses.
- **GUAP is the denomination, not the data.** GUAP suffixes a real total
  ("2 081 GUAP") — it never substitutes for it, never rounds it, never
  becomes a made-up currency conversion.
- Serial numbers (`.ml-serial`) are real provenance — week + build ids,
  slot-round-pick — not decorative gibberish.
- Fine print (`.ml-fineprint`) is for true disclosures (data-as-of lines,
  the self-aware risk disclosure), not for burying facts someone needs.

## Interaction states (every control earns all five)

A control or region isn't done until its loading, empty, error, disabled,
and feedback states are all designed — the components exist, so "the happy
path only" is never a reason:

- **Loading**: static `.ml-skeleton` placeholders per region (aria-hidden,
  `aria-busy` on the container until data lands). No shimmer, ever.
- **Empty**: `.ml-empty` with a *contextual* sentence that names the cause
  and the way out ("No assets match 'jones' — press Esc to clear"), never
  a bare dash or a silent blank.
- **Error**: `.ml-banner--error` + `role="alert"`, stating what failed and
  offering exactly one action (Retry). Recoverable background failures
  (live poll) degrade to status text instead and keep retrying.
- **Disabled**: `aria-disabled="true"` — kept focusable and announced;
  activating it explains itself via the status region. Muted text, hover
  effects off; never opacity-ghosting.
- **Feedback**: every state-changing action produces a receipt — one line
  in the `role="status"` region ("FILLED — …", "UNDONE — …") plus an
  `ml-flash` on the affected row; search/filter changes announce a result
  count. Silent success is a bug.
- Hover ≠ focus: hover is a brightness step; focus is the global ring;
  neither ever substitutes for the other.

## Type

Four faces, four jobs — nothing else, no italic-as-brand:

| Role | Var | Face | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| data | `--ml-font-data` | IBM Plex Mono 400/700 | every numeral column (`.ml-num`), tape, serials, BUY-style micro-actions — tabular by construction, the single most load-bearing "money" face |
| masthead/display | `--ml-font-display` | Archivo 600/800 | mastheads, PDF headlines, table headers that want the annual-report voice (Bebas Neue is retired) |
| engraving | `--ml-font-engraving` | Cinzel 700 | banknote denominations, league name on certificates, `.ml-seal` — the certificate voice, print surfaces only; never body text, never the helper table |
| body | `--ml-font-body` | Inter | everything else |

All four are OFL, self-hosted, and embedded into ml.css as base64 latin
subsets — zero network at runtime (licenses: `data/fonts/OFL_NOTICE.md`).
Numerals in any aligned column get `.ml-num` — columns must never wobble.

The scale is rem-based (root-16px equivalents), smallest to largest:

| Step | rem | Use |
|---|---|---|
| micro | 0.5625 | keeper/rookie/blue-chip/injury mini-badges — legacy floor, no new uses |
| serial | 0.625 | position badges, `.ml-serial` |
| fineprint | 0.65 | `.ml-fineprint` disclosures only — never interactive, never load-bearing facts |
| meta | 0.6875 | secondary facts, panel h2 labels, table headers, `.ml-tape` |
| control | 0.75 | buttons, filters, clock |
| table | 0.8125 | data rows, `.ml-seal` monogram |
| body | 0.875 | prose, inputs |

Rules: emphasis by **weight**, not size; panel headings are small
uppercase muted labels (the `ml-panel > h2` style), never large type — big
type is reserved for the one `<h1>`/masthead per page and for denomination
numbers in PDFs. Nothing new below the fineprint step, and fineprint is
reserved for disclosures.

## Space, radius, elevation

- Spacing only from `space.*`: `xs` hairline gaps, `sm` chip padding,
  `md` component padding, `lg` panel gaps/grid gutters, `xl` page margins.
- Radius: `--ml-r-sm` chips/badges, `--ml-r-md` controls/cards,
  `--ml-r-lg` panels. No pill buttons. The **only** circle is `.ml-seal`
  (an engraving ornament, never a control) — don't mint more.
- Elevation: none. Border hierarchy instead — `--ml-border` for decorative
  container outlines, `--ml-border-strong` for anything a user must locate
  to operate (inputs, buttons, filters). Never promote panel borders to
  strong "for looks", never demote a control border to subtle.
- Guilloché (`design/guilloche.py`) is the only texture: deterministic
  spirograph line work, engraving opacity, print surfaces (and the
  banknote-styled cards) only. No stock textures, no repeating tiles,
  no images.

## Component decision rules

- **Panel** (`ml-panel` + h2): a top-level region of the screen. **Card**
  (`ml-card`): one repeated record (a pick, a round). **Banner**: inline
  context line; `--warn` variant only when the reader should act.
  **Badge**: a categorical fact; never clickable (`--bluechip` marks the
  top market tier and nothing else). **Filter** (`ml-filter`):
  mutually exclusive chip set, `aria-pressed` required. **Table**
  (`ml-table`): anything with ≥3 aligned facts — no div-grids pretending;
  numeric cells get `.ml-num`. **Tape** (`ml-tape`): one static strip of
  market facts (weekly movers) per surface, at most.
- Every interactive element is a real `<button>`/`<input>`; text-look
  actions use `ml-btn--bare`. Click-only divs/rows are banned (a11y gate).
- New UI = existing components composed by page-level **layout** CSS.
  Page CSS never restyles a component and never contains a color. If a
  composition recurs on a second surface, promote it to a component
  (tokens → builder → catalog).

## Device & mode behavior

- Dark theme is the live terminal; light theme is the printed banknote
  (PDFs). Every change must hold in both (the theme toggle and
  `report_base_css()` share tokens) — and remember the light surfaces are
  cream, not white: re-measure any new pair on `surface.light.panel2`.
- Phone: collapse **facts** before shrinking **type** (the helper drops
  Team/Age/Proj columns at ≤480px rather than going below the meta step);
  the decision context (clock, recs) stays above the fold; the header
  sticks. Keep this pattern for any future dense view.
- Coarse pointers get 40px targets; reduced-motion kills the pulse — both
  baked into ml.css; don't reimplement per page.

## Off-brand (reject on sight)

Drop shadows · gradients anywhere but the masthead and the baked-in seal
tint · pill buttons · circles that aren't `.ml-seal` · money emoji or
dollar-sign clip-art in chrome (emoji in *status text* is fine) · Monopoly
man, casino anything — luck is the wrong story for an edge tool · tickers
that move, marquees, ambient motion of any kind · gold spent on anything
but market state and blue chip · green-tinting data that isn't gain/loss ·
GUAP or market slang replacing a real number · a new hue for a new feature
(map it to existing semantics) · color-only meaning · centered numbers in
tables (left text, right numerics, `.ml-num`) · Cinzel in body text or the
helper · headings that outweigh the data · a hex value outside
`design/tokens.json`.
