"""Research Desk — PICK SQUEEZE: who is missing the pick their keeper needs.

Keepers consume a specific round's pick (cost = prior round − 2; waiver
keeps sit at R15), so demand for those picks is inelastic. Two tiers:

  HARD SQUEEZE   a carryover keeper with no owned pick in its round —
                 they must buy that round or lose the keeper.
  BLOCKED ALT    a positive-value alternate whose round is fully consumed
                 by carryovers — they'd need to BUY a pick to keep both.
                 These are the standing sales leads.

a SPARE (seller owns two of the round) costs nothing structural to sell,

holds doubles of — payable in scraps. A full pick set is NOT a monopoly:
whoever holds a spare undercuts you. Demand for a keeper's round is
inelastic — there is no substitute pick, which is exactly what makes
these seats sellable above chart value. Waiver keeps all cost R15, so the R15 seat is the scarcest
asset in the league. Based on PREDICTED keepers until the league locks
(then data/keepers_2026_actual.json takes over); house rule (confirmed): a keeper
missing its exact round seats at the next EARLIER owned free round — so
sell against the BUMP TAX and the burned draft slot, not the keeper's
full value. Only a manager with no earlier free round is truly squeezed.
The empirical value curve is negative past ~R9 (a typical
late pick returns a below-replacement player), so most bump taxes floor
to zero: in THIS league, keeper seats are close to free and late-round
pick trades move almost no expected value — the pick market that
matters is R1-R8. League convention: pick trades run EQUAL COUNT both ways (e.g. R1+R17
for R3+R5) — structure any seat sale as a same-count package where the
round-quality difference carries the price.</p>
