"""Invariant checks on pipeline outputs. Run after any rebuild.

Every check here is a regression we actually shipped once and caught by eye:
  - teams drafting only 1-2 QBs in a superflex league
  - traded picks not applied (Kyle missing his 3 R1s)
  - 3-TE / 6-K rosters from a bad position cap
  - MC cards collapsing multi-pick rounds (14 rows instead of 17)
  - keepers missing from the draft helper at load
  - elite players falling implausibly far on the display board

Exit code 0 = all pass. Non-zero = at least one failed (prints which).
